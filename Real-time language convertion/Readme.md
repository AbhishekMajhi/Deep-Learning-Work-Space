When we went to a different country in case we don't know their language it can be real headache for us. 
So this project can convert one's native(I considered English) lang to the desired language(say German, just to demostrate the usecase) and viceversa.
As a result both parties can communicate with each other without language barrier. 
Here I used TTS(Text To Speech) to achive real-time conversation rather than texting one another.
